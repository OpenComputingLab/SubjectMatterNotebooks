odourless gaseous chemical element. Lightest and most abundant element in the universe. Present in water and in all organic compounds. Chemically reacts with most elements. Discovered by Henry Cavendish in 1776.\",\"Carbon is a member of group 14 of the periodic table. It has three allotropic forms of it, diamonds, graphite and fullerite. Carbon-14 is commonly used in radioactive dating. Carbon occurs in all organic life and is the basis of organic chemistry. Carbon has the interesting chemical property of being able to bond with itself, and a wide variety of other elements.\",\"Colourless, gaseous element which belongs to group 15 of the periodic table. Constitutes ~78% of the atmosphere and is an essential part of the ecosystem. Nitrogen for industrial purposes is acquired by the fractional distillation of liquid air. Chemically inactive, reactive generally only at high temperatures or in electrical discharges. It was discovered in 1772 by D. Rutherford.\",\"A colourless, odourless gaseous element belonging to group 16 of the periodic table. It is the most abundant element present in the earth's crust. It also makes up 20.8% of the Earth's atmosphere. For industrial purposes, it is separated from liquid air by fractional distillation. It is used in high temperature welding, and in breathing. It commonly comes in the form of Oxygen, but is found as Ozone in the upper atmosphere. It was discovered by Priestley in 1774.\",\"Non-metallic element belonging to group 15 of the periodic table. Has a multiple allotropic forms. Essential element for living organisms. It was discovered by Brandt in 1669.\",\"Yellow, nonmetallic element belonging to group 16 of the periodic table. It is an essential element in living organisms, needed in the amino acids cysteine and methionine, and hence in many proteins. Absorbed by plants from the soil as sulphate ion.\",\"Metalloid element, belongs to group 16 of the periodic table. Multiple allotropic forms exist. Chemically resembles sulphur. Discovered in 1817 by Jons J. Berzelius.\",\"Colourless, odourless gaseous nonmetallic element. Belongs to group 18 of the periodic table. Lowest boiling point of all elements and can only be solidified under pressure. Chemically inert, no known compounds. Discovered in the solar spectrum in 1868 by Lockyer.\",\"Colourless gaseous element of group 18 on the periodic table (noble gases). Neon occurs in the atmosphere, and comprises 0.0018% of the volume of the atmosphere. It has a distinct reddish glow when used in discharge tubes and neon based lamps. It forms almost no chemical compounds. Neon was discovered in 1898 by Sir William Ramsey and M.W. Travers.\",\"Monatomic noble gas. Makes up 0.93% of the air. Colourless, odorless.

First produced by Glenn T. Seaborg and associates in 1950.\",\"Appearance is unknown, however it is most probably metallic and silver or gray in color. Radioactive metallic transuranic element belonging to the actinoids. Es-254 has the longest half-life of the eleven known isotopes at 270 days. First identified by Albert Ghiorso and associates in the debris of the 1952 hydrogen bomb explosion. In 1961 the first microgram quantities of Es-232 were separated. While einsteinium never exists naturally, if a sufficient amount was assembled, it would pose a radiation hazard.\",\"Radioactive metallic transuranic element, belongs to the actinoids. Ten known isotopes, most stable is Fm-257 with a half-life of 10 days. First identified by Albert Ghiorso and associates in the debris of the first hydrogen-bomb explosion in 1952.\",\"Radioactive metallic transuranic element. Belongs to the actinoid series. Only known isotope, Md-256 has a half-life of 1.3 hours. First identified by Glenn T. Seaborg, Albert Ghiorso and associates in 1955. Alternative name Unnilunium has been proposed. Named after the 'inventor' of the periodic table, Dmitri Mendeleev.\",\"Radioactive metallic transuranic element, belongs to the actinoids. Seven known isotopes exist, the most stable being No-254 with a half-life of 255 seconds. First identified with certainty by Albert Ghiorso and Glenn T. Seaborg in 1966. Unnilbium has been proposed as an alternative name.\"],\"dipole_polarizability\":{\"__ndarray__\":\"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\",\"dtype\":\"float64\",\"order\":\"little\",\"shape\":[118]},\"dipole_polarizability_unc\":{\"__ndarray__\":\"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\",\"dtype\":\"float64\",\"order\":\"little\",\"shape\":[118]},\"discoverers\":[\"Henry Cavendish\",\"Known to the ancients\",\"Daniel Rutherford\",\"Joseph Priestly, Carl Wilhelm Scheele\",\"Hennig Brand\",\"Known to the ancients.\",\"J\\u00f6ns Berzelius\",\"Sir William Ramsey, Nils Langet, P.T.Cleve\",\"Sir William Ramsey, M.W.

odourless gaseous chemical element. Lightest and most abundant element in the universe. Present in water and in all organic compounds. Chemically reacts with most elements. Discovered by Henry Cavendish in 1776.\",\"Colourless, odourless gaseous nonmetallic element. Belongs to group 18 of the periodic table. Lowest boiling point of all elements and can only be solidified under pressure. Chemically inert, no known compounds. Discovered in the solar spectrum in 1868 by Lockyer.\",\"Socket silvery metal. First member of group 1 of the periodic table. Lithium salts are used in psychomedicine.\",\"Grey metallic element of group 2 of the periodic table. Is toxic and can cause severe lung diseases and dermatitis. Shows high covalent character. It was isolated independently by F. Wohler and A.A. Bussy in 1828.\",\"An element of group 13 of the periodic table. There are two allotropes, amorphous boron is a brown power, but metallic boron is black. The metallic form is hard (9.3 on Mohs' scale) and a bad conductor in room temperatures. It is never found free in nature. Boron-10 is used in nuclear reactor control rods and shields. It was discovered in 1808 by Sir Humphry Davy and by J.L. Gay-Lussac and L.J. Thenard.\",\"Carbon is a member of group 14 of the periodic table. It has three allotropic forms of it, diamonds, graphite and fullerite. Carbon-14 is commonly used in radioactive dating. Carbon occurs in all organic life and is the basis of organic chemistry. Carbon has the interesting chemical property of being able to bond with itself, and a wide variety of other elements.\",\"Colourless, gaseous element which belongs to group 15 of the periodic table. Constitutes ~78% of the atmosphere and is an essential part of the ecosystem. Nitrogen for industrial purposes is acquired by the fractional distillation of liquid air. Chemically inactive, reactive generally only at high temperatures or in electrical discharges. It was discovered in 1772 by D. Rutherford.\",\"A colourless, odourless gaseous element belonging to group 16 of the periodic table. It is the most abundant element present in the earth's crust. It also makes up 20.8% of the Earth's atmosphere. For industrial purposes, it is separated from liquid air by fractional distillation. It is used in high temperature welding, and in breathing. It commonly comes in the form of Oxygen, but is found as Ozone in the upper atmosphere. It was discovered by Priestley in 1774.\",\"A poisonous pale yellow gaseous element belonging to group 17 of the periodic table (The halogens). It is the most chemically reactive and electronegative element. It is highly dangerous, causing severe chemical burns on contact with flesh. Fluorine was identified by Scheele in 1771 and first isolated by Moissan in 1886.\",\"Colourless gaseous element of group 18 on the periodic table (noble gases). Neon occurs in the atmosphere, and comprises 0.0018% of the volume of the atmosphere. It has a distinct reddish glow when used in discharge tubes and neon based lamps. It forms almost no chemical compounds. Neon was discovered in 1898 by Sir William Ramsey and M.W.

odourless gaseous chemical element. Lightest and most abundant element in the universe. Present in water and in all organic compounds. Chemically reacts with most elements. Discovered by Henry Cavendish in 1776.\",\"Colourless, odourless gaseous nonmetallic element. Belongs to group 18 of the periodic table. Lowest boiling point of all elements and can only be solidified under pressure. Chemically inert, no known compounds. Discovered in the solar spectrum in 1868 by Lockyer.\",\"Socket silvery metal. First member of group 1 of the periodic table. Lithium salts are used in psychomedicine.\",\"Grey metallic element of group 2 of the periodic table. Is toxic and can cause severe lung diseases and dermatitis. Shows high covalent character. It was isolated independently by F. Wohler and A.A. Bussy in 1828.\",\"An element of group 13 of the periodic table. There are two allotropes, amorphous boron is a brown power, but metallic boron is black. The metallic form is hard (9.3 on Mohs' scale) and a bad conductor in room temperatures. It is never found free in nature. Boron-10 is used in nuclear reactor control rods and shields. It was discovered in 1808 by Sir Humphry Davy and by J.L. Gay-Lussac and L.J. Thenard.\",\"Carbon is a member of group 14 of the periodic table. It has three allotropic forms of it, diamonds, graphite and fullerite. Carbon-14 is commonly used in radioactive dating. Carbon occurs in all organic life and is the basis of organic chemistry. Carbon has the interesting chemical property of being able to bond with itself, and a wide variety of other elements.\",\"Colourless, gaseous element which belongs to group 15 of the periodic table. Constitutes ~78% of the atmosphere and is an essential part of the ecosystem. Nitrogen for industrial purposes is acquired by the fractional distillation of liquid air. Chemically inactive, reactive generally only at high temperatures or in electrical discharges. It was discovered in 1772 by D. Rutherford.\",\"A colourless, odourless gaseous element belonging to group 16 of the periodic table. It is the most abundant element present in the earth's crust. It also makes up 20.8% of the Earth's atmosphere. For industrial purposes, it is separated from liquid air by fractional distillation. It is used in high temperature welding, and in breathing. It commonly comes in the form of Oxygen, but is found as Ozone in the upper atmosphere. It was discovered by Priestley in 1774.\",\"A poisonous pale yellow gaseous element belonging to group 17 of the periodic table (The halogens). It is the most chemically reactive and electronegative element. It is highly dangerous, causing severe chemical burns on contact with flesh. Fluorine was identified by Scheele in 1771 and first isolated by Moissan in 1886.\",\"Colourless gaseous element of group 18 on the periodic table (noble gases). Neon occurs in the atmosphere, and comprises 0.0018% of the volume of the atmosphere. It has a distinct reddish glow when used in discharge tubes and neon based lamps. It forms almost no chemical compounds. Neon was discovered in 1898 by Sir William Ramsey and M.W.
