    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This online interactive books reviews some of the wide range of Python packages that can be used to create rich and interactive media outputs as part of a Jupyter publishing system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whilst Python programming used may be used to generate the various outputs, the code is not required in order to view the outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, a Jupyter publishing system may be used to provide an environment in which asset generation is scripted and reproducible, as well as providing \"source code\" documents that can be updated and modified in order to update original assets or generate further assets derived from or inspired by them.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the publishing syste, becomes more powerful if scripts are used inline in a document to create document assets (even if the scripts are hidden or removed from the final document). This allows assets to be created in context as part of the execution of the original document. In this way, we can produce publications where there is a very high degree of coupling between each component of the original document. Updating one part of the source code in the document and then reflowing the document will all dependent outputs in the document to be updated automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there is no need for the originating code to be included in the published work. Whilst the originating code can be revealed and made explicit in the rendered work, it might alos be hidden but still available in a collapsed view be made or removed entirely from the final rendered page view.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should also be remembered that not only can the publishing process produce standalone HTML pages: static print style document formats, such `.docx` or PDF dcocuments, can also be generated."

    "## Single Piece Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the ideas suggested herein can be considered in terms of lean manufacturing systems with a a few twists. The aim to to provide a self-contained, self-generating, single piece document flow in which a single document contains all the information required to produce an output document embedding a range of rich media outputs generated by the execution of scripts contained withing the source document. (It is also possible for execution of the source document to generate media assets in a separate file that are then embedded back in the document. The downside then is that you have multiple objects rather than a single piece.)"
